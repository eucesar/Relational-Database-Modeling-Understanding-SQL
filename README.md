# Relational-Database-Modeling-Understanding-SQL
ðŸŒ±ðŸ“š - I learned SQL for relational model, installed MySQL, created schemas/tables, added constraints/referential integrity, defined primary/foreign keys, insert data in different ways, used WHERE for filters, deleted/updated information, applied aggregate functions and joined tables with INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN and RIGHT JOIN - all with MySQL.
